# Predict the Publishing Material Type

We are living in a world full of technology. Probably when we think about the 10 years challenge, we look back and think, how things have changed, how fast we have actually progressed and the sole reason is the level of research quality that is being done with the available resources. And because of so much research, there’s a huge competition between the new publishers and they look for really good marketing companies. And living in a digital world, people prefer to read articles online or watch videos rather than reading a book. As a member of a marketing agency, you’re given a dataset having the title, subjects and other features based on which you have to predict what will be the material of that to-be-published research so that you can tie-up with an ideal publisher and help them grow. The following are the material types:

Book


Sounddisc

Videocass

Soundcass

Music

Mixed

Cr

You have to predict the column “MaterialType”  note evaluation criteria will be the weighted f1-score.
